Currently the internal Bluetooth chip on Raspberry Pi devices does not work by
default on 64-bit images of Kali. 

Some additional manual work is needed to make this device function properly on
this OS. Note that this only affects the integrated BT chip. External sniffers
such as the nordic RF BTLE sniffer and the ubertooth should work fine without
needing to follow these instructions.

Make sure you run these commands as root or sudo unless otherwise specified.

First, you'll need to modify /etc/systemd/system/hciuart.service. The btuart
executable referenced in this file does not exist on Kali 64-bit, so we need
to directly call the bluez executable responsible for adding serial devices,
hciattach.

Comment out the existing ExecStart line in the unit file and replace it with
the following line:
	ExecStart=/usr/bin/hciattach /dev/ttyAMA0 bcm43xx 3000000 noflow -

Save your changes to the file and reload the systemd units:
	systemctl daemon-reload
	
This will allow the BlueZ subsystem to interface with the device, but we also
need to setup the device's firmware so that hciattach loads it on device 
initialization. Otherwise you get an invalid MAC address and other improper
behavior from the device.

By default on kali 64-bit for the raspberry pi, hciattach looks for firmware
in the /etc/firmware directory and its subdirectories. This directory doesn't
actually exist on this image, so we need to create a symlink to where the
firmware actually lives, /lib/firmware. We can do that with:
	ln -s /lib/firmware /etc/firmware

We also need to pull the firmware for the chip being used in the Raspberry Pi,
as the 64-bit Kali image for the Pi doesn't ship with it right now.

Go to: https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/tree/master/broadcom and
pull the BCM4345C5.hcd and BCM4345C0.hcd. Place them in /lib/firmware/brcm.

Now you'll want to start up the hciuart service to try and connect the device
to the system:
	systemctl start hciuart
	
After a second, we can try the hciconfig tool to check if the device has been
added. Run:
	hciconfig -a
	
You should get several lines of output for device hci0. Make sure that your MAC
address is NOT all A's, as this indicates a problem loading firmware.

Finally, make sure the hciuart service is set to start automatically on boot.
It should be set this way by default, but just to make sure, run:
	systemctl enable hciuart
	
Your raspberry pi's bluetooth should now be fully functional on Kali 64-bit.
Note that you should periodically check the bluez-firmware repo you pulled the
firmware from for updates, as new firmware versions may correct bugs.

One final note, although hciattach and hciconfig are deprecated, these tools
appear to be the only ones that properly setup the bluetooth for the Pi on Kali
right now. btattach doesn't set the right baud rate, so while the BT connection
does come up, the baud rate is far lower than the device supports.

Kali 64-bit doesn't ship with the firmware for the BT chip right now.
We need to grab it from here: https://github.com/RPi-Distro/bluez-firmware/tree/master/broadcom
Grab the BCM4345C5.hcd and BCM4345C0.hcd files, place in /etc/firmware/brcm
