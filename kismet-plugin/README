kismet Event Bus Forwarder.

This plugin uses the KismetExternal API and Python tools to connect to Kismet
and forward NEW_DEVICE events to another program using UNIX sockets.

Installing:
1. Create the eventbus_forwarder directory whereever kismet system plugins
are loaded from (usually /usr/lib/kismet, but some systems are different).

2. Copy the manifest file to the eventbus_forwarder directory

3. Copy the kismet_eventbus_forwarder python script to /usr/bin

4. Make the kismet_eventbus_forwarder script executable

5. Install the kismetexternal python package from pip:
   pip3 install kismetexternal

Notes:
This plugin is used primarily to get event data from kismet into the
middleware and data processing subsystem of the bluetooth surveillance
program. 

After processing, the middleware will either send a request to the notification
server requesting that a notification be sent to the user, or do nothing.

Most of the interesting stuff happens in the middleware, this portion is
relatively light to avoid bogging down kismet.
