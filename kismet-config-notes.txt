When using Kismet for Bluetooth scanning over prolongged periods of time the
device list can grow quite large. This can also cause the Kismet logfile(s)
to grow beyond what is needed.

Some tweaking to kismet's settings is needed to address this.

The following changes need to be made in /etc/kismet/kismet_memory.conf:
	Enable the tracker_device_timeout option and set to 30 minutes
	Enable the tracker_max_devices option and set to 500
	Set the keep_location_cloud_history to false
	Set the keep_datasource_signal_history to false

And these changes in /etc/kismet/kismet_logging.conf:
	Set kis_log_packets to false
	Set kis_log_messages to false
	Set kis_log_channel_history to false
	Set kis_log_gps_track to false
	Set kis_log_system_status to false

These are intial notes and not (yet) derived from actual testing. More info
will be added as development continues and performance data becomes available.
